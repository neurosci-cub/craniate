                        <h3>The Science Behind It:</h3>
                        <p>We rely on our vision to tell us about the food we’re about to eat. Color, size, shape, carbonation, temperature and viscosity (meaning thickness, like with milkshakes) are some visual characteristics that we determine about what we consume before it touches our mouths.  

In this case, the darker a food is, the more likely it will have a stronger flavor—at least that’s how it works with fruit, evolutionarily. Our brains learn common patterns and then incorporates it into a perception. 

Advertisers use well-known associations with color to market products. For example, healthy, organic and eco-friendly products are often green, while clean, light, or watery products are often blue. Ever go to a fast food restaurant? Next time you do, see how often they use red, yellow and orange. </p>
